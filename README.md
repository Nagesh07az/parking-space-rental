1. Project Title

Parking Space Rental Smart Contract


---

2. Project Description

This Clarity smart contract enables users to rent parking spaces for a specified number of hours on the Stacks blockchain. The system stores rental details including the renter's principal address, rental duration, and rental status for each parking space.
It demonstrates a minimal approach with only two functions â€” renting a space and retrieving its details.


---

3. Project Vision

To create a decentralized, transparent, and automated parking space management system that removes the need for intermediaries. This contract ensures fair allocation of parking spaces on a first-come, first-served basis, with immutable rental records stored on-chain.


---

4. Future Scope

Integration of STX payments for parking space rental fees.

Support for multiple parking locations and tiered pricing.

Automated release of spaces after rental duration expires.

User ratings and reputation system for parking lot owners.

Mobile and web interfaces for easy booking and management.
